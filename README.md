# SeeKAT-app
A browser app version of the SeeKAT localiser for transient single pulses found in beamformed searches. It uses flask as an interface between SeeKAT and the web application, and bokeh for the interactive plotting.

Note: the standalone version of SeeKAT is available here: https://github.com/BezuidenhoutMC/SeeKAT
